# CMP202 Project

## Ideas

* BlackJack Basic Training Simulator
    * Will allow the user to play round sof blackjack for practice
    * User can run simulations on different amounts of Decks to output a Basic Strategy Chart
    * Sim Part:
        * Run sims for each of these:
            *  10-20 Player Hand v 2-Ace Dealer up-card
            *  100 scenarios per sim
    
## How to use
* Playing rounds of Black Jack
    * Select Menu option 1
    * Enter the amount of Decks in stack
    * Play BlackJack 
    * Profit, but not really, house always wins
    
* Multi Threaded Simulation
    * Select Menu Option 2
    * Enter amount of Sims
    * Enter amount of Decks in stack
    * Wait
    * Do some excel magic to turn it into a chart
    * Maybe Profit?
    
* Sequential Single Threaded Simulation
    * Don't do this its slow
    * Menu option 3
    * Only here to benchmark and show off how good my multi threaded approach is
    * I guess use it if you need to run more than 68,100 simulations but then again why would you do that
    * But then again I tried running 1 Million sims as soon as this was ready, cos reasons i guess?
    * I need to get out and get a life don't I
